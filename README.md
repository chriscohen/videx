# Videx scrape test

## Prerequisites

* PHP >= 7.2
* Composer - either **composer.phar** in the root of the project, or a global installation.

## Standards

PHP code is written to [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) standards. PHP_CodeSniffer is installed as a dev
package by composer, to validate these standards.

The **.editorconfig** file defines the indent and line ending style for all code files, which use Symfony standards:
UNIX-style (\n) line endings with 4-space indents.

## Setup

The **composer.lock** file is included for easy installation.

```composer install```

or

```php composer.phar install```
